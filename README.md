# common-sockets
Implemented classes for network sockets. 
There are simple classes that can be used as an example during designing code, that need to use raw TCP 
server/client connection. 
  
# Code snippets  
In order to have clue on using classes, pleae have a look to [tcp.hpp](include/common/io/socket/tcp.hpp)
